THOR Cloud
==========

This section focuses on our online platform ``THOR Cloud``.

THOR Cloud eliminates the need for on-premise systems for
licensing and scanner package downloads. With THOR Cloud,
all you need is a small yet powerful tool known as the THOR
Cloud launcher. Simply bring it to your endpoint or allow
end users to download and execute it themselves.

Download THOR Cloud Launcher Script
-----------------------------------

Once you logged into your THOR Cloud account, create a new Campaign
or use an existing one. In the Campaign details, download the Launcher
in the top right corner. You need to download the Script for your Operating
System, as the Live Response feature only allows the execution of scripts.

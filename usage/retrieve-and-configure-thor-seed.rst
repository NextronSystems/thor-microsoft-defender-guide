Retrieve and Configure THOR Seed
================================

Download THOR Seed using Voucher Trials
---------------------------------------

Trial users receive a link that leads to a web page, which lists the
attributes of the voucher including start date, expiration date,
the life time of each license and quota statistics.

You have to read and accept the EULA and check the box to enable the
download links.

Download THOR Seed in Customer Portal
-------------------------------------

Every applicable contract in our customer portal shows a certain "Cloud" button
in the ``Actions`` column, which leads you to a THOR Seed download page.

The THOR Seed download page lists all attributes of the contract

details on the terms)

Configure THOR Seed (Optional)
------------------------------

THOR Seed is the PowerShell script that retrieves THOR packages with a
valid license for the end system on which it was started, executes a
THOR scan and cleans up afterwards.

| You can find more information on Github:
| https://github.com/NextronSystems/nextron-helper-scripts/tree/master/thor-seed

The version that you've retrieved from our customer portal already
contains a token that is connected with you voucher trial or contract.
It is also configured to use our cloud systems to retrieve THOR
packages. (users of the ASGARD platform can also use an on-premise
ASGARD server to retrieve package from that local system)

Modify the Default Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the section “PRESET CONFIGS” you can modify or choose different scan
options.

The `THOR manual <https://thor-manual.nextron-systems.com/en/latest/>`_ contains a complete description of most of these
features and can downloaded from the “Downloads” section in the Nextron
customer portal.

Define False Positive Filters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

THOR Seed also includes a section in which you could include false
positive statements (separated by new line) and defined as regular
expressions.

   False Positive filters

It's important to use escaping as it is used in regular expressions to
escape e.g., back slashes, periods, dollar and asterisk characters. The
expression is applied to a full log line. The `THOR manual <https://thor-manual.nextron-systems.com/en/latest/>`_ has more
information on these filters and a list of examples.
